**What is your educational qualification?**  
I have done BE IT and MBA Entrepreneurship.

**Which part of India do you belong to?**  
I am from Vadodara, Gujara  

**Why IT?**  
Since childhood, I loved technology, so much that I volunteered to manage my university network along with studying. I realised that turning my passion into my profession would be the best thing to do.  

**Have you ever worked in an IT company?**  
I worked in an IT company in Hyderabad named Payism Technologies Pvt Ltd. Heck, I had my own IT company for a year where people worked for me!  

**Did you join any course to learn Ruby on Rails?**  
No. I have learned it by reading books, codes, articles, documentation, and a lot of experimentation.

**What is the best thing about freelancing?**  
The best thing is that there is no fixed time and location constraint.

**As a freelancer, how many clients do you work with at a time?**  
I try to keep one client at a time, two at most.

**What do your clients like the most about you?**  
My friendly nature and a sense of ownership I work with.

**Have you had “unhappy clients”?!! If yes, then how did you deal with them?**  
Very few. I found better clients for myself!

**What is the method of communication you use with your clients?**  
We do video calls during the first few meetings while we are shaping up the idea and the client
briefs me about the project. Then I prefer to do more of written communication and fewer meetings
and calls. I am fortunate that most of the time it has worked without any hassle.

**What are your working hours?**  
My working hours are flexible, but I keep it to 6-8 hours a day. I work as an early riser but not a
night owl. Most of my clients are in the CST timezone and I have been able to work with them
without compromising my or their personal life and health.

**How do you get clients?**  
I am often referred by previous clients. I also get work from [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tannakartikey/), [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01393c9ea8f23bfff3), and even [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@tannakartikey)

**What do you do when you are between projects?**  
It is the best time to pay full attention and learn something. You can also contribute to open-source, improve your profile, and work on personal projects. I prefer to do all of them.
