title:  "Why I freelance, and why should you too."
---

I kicked off my career by working at a typical 9 to 6 IT firm. A few days into the job, I realized I was wasting my time. Outside the office, I wouldn't need a break-even after working for hours. But at the office, I would keep eyeing the clock, and there were many others like me! So I realized I wasn't the one malfunctioning! 

There are times when you feel like starting your day late or feel like cooking a delicious meal for yourself and your wife or come across something worth learning and spending a few hours over it. It can even be beautiful weather worth going out for a walk! In such times, we cannot command our minds to kindle the mood to work even when we don't want to.

I have been working as a freelancer for five years and have been enjoying every moment of it. I work for around 35 hours a week and don’t have the pressure to follow the routine. I work from anywhere, don’t have to report to anyone, and take out a good time for myself and my family!

I also choose with whom I want to work. After interacting with the client initially, if I feel that the client and I have different work philosophies fundamentally, I can choose not to work with them! For example, my work philosophy is that I never work more than 40 hours unless there is an emergency, write tests when you write code. If a client wants me to work over weekends and more than 8 hours a day because they want to release their product early, I can decide not to agree to it and not take such projects.

Let’s talk about money! As a freelancer, you are rarely underpaid, as you can charge your client according to your skills and effort. Whereas in a job, people are often underpaid. Additionally, if you are salaried, you need to wait for an increment regardless of how much expertise you have attained, unlike in freelancing.
 
In the end, I feel that you should either work for yourself or work for a company that values you and your growth because life is too short to slog and be underpaid!
