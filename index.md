I am a fullstack web developer with 5 years of experience. 2+ years of experience with Ruby on Rails.

I like to write code which is readable, has excellent test coverage, and easily maintainable.

I can be found cooking, meditating and playing video games when I am not coding.

Working environment: Vim with Tmux on Zsh
